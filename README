# AI-Based Answer Scoring: Calculation Documentation

## Overview

This document explains how student answers are scored based on keyword matching, including both exact and fuzzy matching. The system is designed to evaluate short answers by comparing them to a list of predefined keywords, awarding partial credit for close matches.

---

## Scoring Logic

* Each question has a total mark (e.g., 5 marks).
* Keywords are defined for the model answer.
* Student answers are compared against these keywords.
* Matching logic:

  * **Exact Match:** Full point awarded.
  * **Fuzzy Match:** If similarity > 0.7, half point awarded.
* Final score is calculated as:

  ```
  Score = ((Exact Matches + 0.5 * Fuzzy Matches) / Total Keywords) * Total Marks
  ```

## Example: "Define gravity"

* **Total Marks:** 5
* **Keywords:** \['gravity', 'force', 'pulls', 'objects']

### Example 1: Strong Answer

**Student Answer:** "Gravity is a force that pulls all objects toward the earth."

| Keyword | Match Type | Points |
| ------- | ---------- | ------ |
| gravity | Exact      | 1      |
| force   | Exact      | 1      |
| pulls   | Exact      | 1      |
| objects | Exact      | 1      |

**Score Calculation:**

```
(4 / 4) * 5 = 5.0
```

### Example 2: Partial with Fuzzy Match

**Student Answer:** "It attracts stuff due to gravity."

| Keyword | Match Type | Points |
| ------- | ---------- | ------ |
| gravity | Exact      | 1      |
| force   | Fuzzy      | 0.5    |
| pulls   | No Match   | 0      |
| objects | No Match   | 0      |

**Score Calculation:**

```
(1 + 0.5) / 4 * 5 = 1.875 → 1.88
```

### Example 3: Poor Answer

**Student Answer:** "It is important in life."

| Keyword | Match Type | Points |
| ------- | ---------- | ------ |
| gravity | No Match   | 0      |
| force   | No Match   | 0      |
| pulls   | No Match   | 0      |
| objects | No Match   | 0      |

**Score Calculation:**

```
(0 / 4) * 5 = 0.0
```

### Example 4: Rephrased Good Attempt

**Student Answer:** "The thing that causes objects to fall is gravity."

| Keyword | Match Type | Points |
| ------- | ---------- | ------ |
| gravity | Exact      | 1      |
| force   | Fuzzy      | 0.5    |
| pulls   | No Match   | 0      |
| objects | Exact      | 1      |

**Score Calculation:**

```
(2 + 0.5) / 4 * 5 = 3.125 → 3.13
```

## Summary Table

| Student Answer Quality | Exact Matches | Fuzzy Matches | Final Score (out of 5) |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Full correct           | 4             | 0             | 5.00                   |
| Partial w/ fuzzy       | 1             | 1             | 1.88                   |
